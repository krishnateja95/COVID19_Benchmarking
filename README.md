This repository is the official implementation of "[ConVision Benchmark](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-2688/5/3/56)" paper 


We implemented CNN and ViT models in such a way a single model file contains the entire description of model without having to import any extra module (except torch and torchvision). For example, efficientnet_b0.py file contains the full code for Efficientnet_b0 model. One can directly use the file for any Computer vision application.  


We referred to several open source repositories for [CNN](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/torchvision/models) and [ViT](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch) models
